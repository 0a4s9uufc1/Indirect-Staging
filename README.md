### Description

This project was made by me from the help of the MalDev malware development online course. I have learnt a lot from this course and this was a final project from the course. In this project I combined some of the things that I have learnt from the course to be able to create a feature full payload that bypasses AV solutions.

### INFO

I am still going forwads with this course and will definetly come back to this project to add some other features to make it harder for the payload to be analysed and will try other methods of evading AVs and different injection techniques.
