### Description

This is a project that I have been working on for a couple weeks now. I have been doing malware development for probably 5 months or so now and I am still learning so much and I originally made this just to learn how to use payload staging to have the malware download the shellcode from the internet instead of having the shellcode inside of the binary to avoid static analysis.

### INFO

I am still going forwads with this course and will definetly come back to this project to add some other features to make it harder for the payload to be analysed and will try other methods of evading AVs and different injection techniques.
